'''
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

'''
the overall time complexity is O(n)

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        result={}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
